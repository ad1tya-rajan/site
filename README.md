[**CRISPR-Cas9 Off-Target Prediction**](https://github.com/ad1tya-rajan/CRISPR-ML)

- Engineered a data analysis pipeline (processing, feature extraction, EDA) for a dataset of 340,000+ gRNA sequences, extracting relevant features (e.g., GC 
  content, sequence length, Levenshtein distance) to optimise model performance
- Developed and evaluated baseline predictive machine learning models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost), achieving ROC-AUC scores exceeding 0.93 and a accuracies of ~98%
- Created a modern transformer-based architecture to use Positional Encoding and Multi-Head Attention during gRNA sequence analysis
- Implemented sequence-to-numeric transformations (one-hot encoding) to retain critical sequence information for ML applications

[**Ferric - Network Port Scanning CLI Tool**](https://github.com/ad1tya-rajan/Rust-Ferric-Port-Scanner)

- Created a user-oriented, nmap-like CLI tool that scans network ports (TCP, HTTP, etc.) in Rust
- Implemented multithreading, asynchronous code, logging & error handling for optimization
- Analyzed Rust networking documentation, crate management & production methods
- Understood fundamentals of networking & cybersecurity applications

[**A-Star Search Algorithm Visualizer**](https://github.com/ad1tya-rajan/Rust-Ferric-Port-Scanner)
  
- Developed an interactive visualization tool for A* Search Pathfinding Algorithm in Python
- Implemented A* Graph Traversal and Search in Python to find the Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) in a user-generated maze-like graph
- Recorded mouse events & built responsive UI elements with the Pygame library

[**Real-time COVID-19 Facemask Detection Model**](https://github.com/ad1tya-rajan/python-projects)
  
- Created a real-time COVID-19 facemask detection tool using webcam input and machine learning
- Implemented the Support Vector Machines (SVM) machine learning algorithm with Scikit-Learn and achieved an accuracy of 96.2%
- Used OpenCV to handle computer vision, real-time webcam input and supplementary data collection

[**Buffon's Needle Mathematical Puzzle Simulation**](https://github.com/ad1tya-rajan/python-projects)
  
- Developed Python code to simulate Buffon's Needle (a mathematical problem used to approximate the value of pi)
- Calculated optimal randomisation strategies for 'needle tossing' to effectively simulate the problem
- Created responsive UI elements to display needle tosses, track observed values of pi and show convergence to the true value of pi
